# Workflows

Combine commands to build faster explain loops.

## Batch explain

1. Summarize the file.
2. Explain the most complex function.
3. Ask for an example.

## Inline refactor

Run **Explain and Refactor** when the original logic is stable but hard to read. The refactor output is best for onboarding docs or PR notes.

## Debug flow

When output is confusing, ask for:

- "List assumptions"
- "Point to missing context"
- "Suggest test cases"
