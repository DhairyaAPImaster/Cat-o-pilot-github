# Cat-o-pilot

We all know that feeling: you find a project you like on GitHub, download the code, and want to make changes—but then you realize the code is extremely messy, has zero comments, or is just plain complicated.

##  INTRODUCING CAT-O-PILOT!

That is why I created **Cat-o-Pilot**. It is an extension for VS Code that explains code that is complicated or just plain messy. 

But where is the fun in a standard explainer? Here is the twist: **It explains the code using cats.** YES, CATS!

### Key Features
* **Feline Logic:** Understand complex code through cat-themed explanations.
* **Audio Feedback:** Real random "meow" sounds play after every response.
* **Visual Flair:** Includes custom cat images curated from across the web.
