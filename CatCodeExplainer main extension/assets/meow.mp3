This is a placeholder for the meow.mp3 file.
In a real implementation, you would replace this with an actual MP3 audio file.
The file should be a short cat meow sound (1-2 seconds).

To add a real meow sound:
1. Find a free cat meow sound online (e.g., from freesound.org, zapsplat.com)
2. Convert it to MP3 format
3. Replace this file with the actual audio file
4. Keep it under 500KB for performance

The webview will automatically play this sound when a cat response is displayed.
